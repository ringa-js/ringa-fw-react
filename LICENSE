# Affero GNU Public License 3.0

**All code under `ringa-fw-react` is licensed under AGPL 3.0.**

The Affero GPL license is a basic variation over the GPL that also covers web users: You must also provide the source code of your program if its accessed through a network, not only direct users.

This means that if you decide to use `ringa-fw-react` for your project for the Internet, you must allow users to download the source code to all Internet users. This is a logical extension of the GPL to be used on the Web.

The full license text is at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html, if you have any doubt, please read the full text to ensure your software will comply.

## Commercial support

If you do not want to comply with the AGPL clauses you can purchase a ringa-fw-react commercial license. For more information, visit https://www.ringajs.com/purchase/.
